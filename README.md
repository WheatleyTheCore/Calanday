# Calenday
A web app to hopefully help streamline your workday/calendar workflow. 

Here's the overall process:
1. you export your workday schedule as an excel file
2. you give that to calenday
3. calenday generates a .ics file (standardized calendar file)
4. you import that into your calendar program
5. profit!
